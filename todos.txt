NEXT:
  - make a bot
  - fix the postgres password in Kubernetes, don't hardcode it in connection string 
  - fix the /health and /alive endpoints so that middleware skips them
  - test the middleware that logs activity time
  - more readable error messages for users
  - room size cap
  - in PlayersInfo use flag IsActive and then remove rooms based on the active users count
  - get rid of all the warnings

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
  - integration tests
  - end to end tests (client simulations)
  - maximum performance logging
