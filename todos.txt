NEXT:
  - fix the postgres password in Kubernetes, don't hardcode it in connection string 
  - fix the /health and /alive endpoints so that they skip middleware
  - add middleware that would log user activity in the database
  - make a bot
  - more readable error messages for users
  - room size cap
  - in PlayersInfo use flag IsActive and then remove rooms based on the active users count

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
  - integration tests
  - end to end tests (client simulations)
  - maximum performance logging
