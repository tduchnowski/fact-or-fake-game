  - real questions from the DB
  - create room fields validation (ranges for roundsNum and roundTimeout in room creation)
  - errors in the app:
    - solo mode is a good start (only HttpClient can fail)
    - most functions return OperationResult, use it
    - unexpected internal server errors
    - connection errors, handling reconnection
